<h1>This repository contains simple implementations of fundamental algorithms in Python. Below is a brief overview of each algorithm included:</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h2>Bubble Sort:</h2>
            <p>Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process continues until the list is sorted.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Euclidean Algorithm for Greatest Common Divisor (GCD):</h2>
            <p>The Euclidean algorithm is a method for finding the greatest common divisor of two integers. It repeatedly applies the division algorithm to find the remainder of the division of two numbers until the remainder is zero.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Fibonacci Sequence Display:</h2>
            <p>The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Insertion Sort:</h2>
            <p>Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It iterates through the input elements, shifting them one position to the right until finding the correct position for insertion.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Find the Smallest Element in an Array:</h2>
            <p>This algorithm finds the smallest element in an array by iterating through the array and comparing each element with the current smallest element found so far.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Feel free to explore and use these algorithms in your Python projects! If you have any questions or suggestions for improvement, please don't hesitate to reach out.</p>
    <p><strong>Happy coding!</strong></p>
